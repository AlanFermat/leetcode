Top down: Memoizatation - solve the problem in natural order by recursive calls
						All entries in the tabulets are not filled necessarily in a way such that 
						some of the subproblems may not be solved at all

Bottom-up: Tabulation (Table filling problem) - solve it from the smaller subproblem then larger one
						every subproblem must be solved at least once
